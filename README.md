# Django_OTS_Website
I developed this online testing website using python Django framework. 
User can see a welcome page,from where he/she can read all needful details of OTS and link to create an account, and link to login for registered user.
Once logged in , user can see home page from where he/she can select a test paper from the list of test papers.
Once the test paper is selected user can see test page where a list of questions with options to select as answer.Finally submit the test and result page will appear.
